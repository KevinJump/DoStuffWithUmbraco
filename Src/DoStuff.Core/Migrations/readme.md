# Migrations

Umbraco Migrations allow you to control the struture of 
the database, create tables, columns, indexes, run custom SQL
and genrally do everything you need to prep any custom 
stuff you might have in the Database. 

## Migration Plan
A Migration plan tells umbraco how to get from one state of 
your application to another, in genral this will be how to 
install your app, create tables etc. but when you do upgrades
it will also tell umbraco how to do them.

## Migration
A Migration is a single element that does something, this 
is where you create a table or update and index etc. 

in umbraco 8 there is a simple `Migrate` method that is called when
umbraco is running the migrations -this is where you do stuff.

## Post Migration
After all the migrations have ran, post migrations run, this
is the place you might want to put code that happens as the end


## Note about execution order
Its important to note that any SQL generated by a migration 
doesn't run there and then. instead it is bulked together
by the Migration Runner and all ran together. 

This is subtle but important, because if you add a migration
and then immediatly think you can do something in code with the
data - you can't 

To manipulate the data from a migration use a post migration step.
